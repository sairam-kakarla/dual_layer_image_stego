# Source Code
 - ```src/read_pgm.c``` Contains functions to load the grayscale values from pgm file into memory.
 - ```src/write_pgm.c``` Contains functions to create a pgm file from grascale values in memory.
 - ```src/encode_in_pgm.c``` Contains functions for implementing parallel encoding.
 - ```src/decode_from_pgm.c```Contains function for implementing parallel decoding
 - ```src/PGM.h``` Header file for project.
 - ```src/bit_operations.c``` Contains functions to extract bit information and to generate random secret for testing.
